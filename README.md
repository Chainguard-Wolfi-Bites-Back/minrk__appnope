# `appnope`

Simple extension for disabling App Nap on OS X 10.9,
which can be problematic.

Simply `import appnope`, and App Nap should be disabled.

This is my first Cocoa Python extension, so it may not work for anyone but me,
but it could be interesting.

To install, just:

    pip install appnope

or

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/minrk/appnope#egg=appnope
